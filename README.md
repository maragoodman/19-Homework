# React Employee Directory

## Overview

Employee directory using React and AJAX call being made to a Random User API. Broke down application's UI into components, managed component state, and responses to user events.

## User Story

- As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.

The user should be able to:

- Sort the table by at least one category

- Filter the users by at least one property.
